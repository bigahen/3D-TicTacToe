# 3D-TicTacToe
Collaborative 3D TicTacToe Game

This is an extension of a program where the user plays a game of 3D Tic Tac Toe against an AI. In this version, my partner Andrew and I
both created our own AI to compete agaisnt each other in a game. In a sample of 1000 games, my AI won 537, tied 108, and lost 355. 

My AI works my scanning every possible move to make and checking it see if this creates a new row of three. If the AI finds one, it
chooses this space. If no rows of 3 can be made, a random space is chosen. This program could be improved my having the AI determine if
any moves create more than one 3 in a row. As it is right now, the AI simply chooses the first it finds.
